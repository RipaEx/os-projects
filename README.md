# DEPRECATION NOTICE: We're no longer keeping this repository up to date.
Over time we've realized that the os-projects repo is not the best way to highlight the projects in
our ecosystem. Notably it's mostly hidden from the rest of the world, we're not differentiating
which projects are actively supported and which ones need some love, and really showing these off
with the rest of Stellar's developer resources.

Our goal is to turn a lot of these projects (after an audit) into a gallery on our website in early
2019. For now, this is an existing repository of OSS projects for Stellar.
